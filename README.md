# Introduction
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset. The dataset provides detailed information on various restaurants in Bangalore, including ratings, location, cuisine, cost, and more. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights about the restaurant landscape in Bangalore, clean and preprocess the data, and visualize trends to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on over 12,000 restaurants across Bangalore, including attributes such as restaurant name, cuisine, location, average cost for two, user rating, and more.
# Project Objectives
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  - Remove unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
  - Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
  - Convert data types where necessary for consistency.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Analyze the distribution of restaurant ratings and their variations across different areas and cuisines.
  - Investigate cost patterns and how they relate to restaurant ratings and types.
  - Examine the popularity of different cuisines in various locations.
### 3.Data Visualization:
  - Utilize libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that depict trends and patterns within the dataset.
  - Create bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots to visualize relationships between key variables.
